# Responsive layout

## Purpose

Keep all admin actions and information usable across small screens, desktop, zoom and long content.

## Mandatory requirements

1. Start with a compact single-column layout. Add columns when content has enough space, not because
   a familiar device width exists. Prefer fluid widths and bounded maximum content widths.
2. Use shrinkable flex/grid children: `min-width: 0` and `minmax(0, 1fr)` where appropriate.
   Permit text wrapping; use overflow containment for legitimately wide content, not the whole page.
3. Stack authentication columns and metric groups at compact widths. Adapt the sidebar into a
   compact header without hiding essential destinations or relying on hover.
4. Preserve touch targets, keyboard focus and reading order. A visually rearranged layout must not
   create a confusing DOM or tab order.
5. Handle long names, email addresses, translated-length labels and multi-line errors. Avoid fixed
   heights that clip text. Reserve reasonable loading space to limit disruptive layout shifts.
6. Review portrait/landscape and zoom as well as width. Browser emulation is useful but not proof of
   actual mobile device behavior. Humans run browser verification.

## Do

```css
.metrics {
	display: grid;
	grid-template-columns: minmax(0, 1fr);
	gap: var(--space-4);
}

@media (min-width: 48rem) {
	.metrics {
		grid-template-columns: repeat(2, minmax(0, 1fr));
	}
}
```

The breakpoint is illustrative: retain it only if the actual content fits comfortably.

## Do not

```css
/* WRONG: a fixed desktop canvas overflows compact viewports. */
.dashboard {
	width: 1440px;
	height: 900px;
	overflow: hidden;
}
```

Do not solve overflow by hiding the affected information or shrinking controls below usable sizes.

## Prevented failures and review checklist

- Fluid, shrinkable layouts prevent horizontal page scrolling and clipped operational data.
- Preserved navigation prevents mobile users losing functionality.
- Review 320/768/1440px, zoom, orientation, long content, errors and pending states.
- See [styling.md](styling.md), [accessibility.md](accessibility.md) and [design.md](design.md).
